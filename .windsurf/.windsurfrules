## SpendMila Project Architecture and Development Guide

### Project Overview

SpendMila is a comprehensive financial management application that helps users track their finances, manage budgets, monitor debts, set financial goals, and track subscriptions and transactions. The application follows a modern architecture with a clear separation between backend and frontend components.

### Architecture Overview

#### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

The backend follows a clean architecture pattern with the following components:

1. **Models** (`/backend/app/models/`)
   - SQLModel-based data models that define the database schema
   - Each entity has its own model file (e.g., `transaction.py`, `financial_goal.py`)

2. **Schemas** (`/backend/app/schemas/`)
   - Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
   - Define data transfer objects (DTOs) for API interactions
   - Include base, create, read, update schemas for each entity

3. **CRUD Operations** (`/backend/app/crud/`)
   - Database operations for each entity
   - Implement create, read, update, delete operations
   - Handle relationships between entities

4. **API Routes** (`/backend/app/api/routes/`)
   - FastAPI route definitions
   - Implement RESTful endpoints for each entity
   - Handle authentication and authorization

5. **Services** (`/backend/app/services/`)
   - Business logic implementation
   - Complex operations that span multiple entities

#### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, following a component-based architecture:

1. **Components** (`/frontend/src/components/`)
   - Reusable UI components
   - Organized by feature or entity (e.g., Transactions, Dashboard)
   - Modal components in `/frontend/src/components/Modals/`

2. **Hooks** (`/frontend/src/hooks/`)
   - Custom React hooks for data fetching and state management
   - Entity-specific hooks (e.g., `useTransactions.ts`, `useGoals.ts`)

3. **API Client** (`/frontend/src/client/services/`)
   - API service classes for interacting with the backend
   - One service file per entity (e.g., `TransactionService.ts`)

4. **Types** (`/frontend/src/types/`)
   - TypeScript interfaces and types
   - Shared types across components

5. **Pages** (`/frontend/src/pages/`)
   - Page-level components
   - Route-specific components

6. **UI Components** (`/frontend/src/components/ui/`)
   - Tailwind-based UI components
   - Design system implementation

### Adding New Functionality

When adding new functionality to SpendMila, follow these guidelines to maintain the project's architecture and best practices.

#### Backend Implementation

1. **Define the Data Model**
   - Create a new model file in `/backend/app/models/`

2. **Create Schemas**
   - Add schema definitions in `/backend/app/schemas/`
   - Create base, create, read, and update schemas

3. **Implement CRUD Operations**
   - Create a new file in `/backend/app/crud/` for database operations

4. **Create API Routes**
   - Add a new file in `/backend/app/api/routes/` for API endpoints

5. **Register the Router**
   - Update `/backend/app/api/routes/__init__.py` to include the new router

#### Frontend Implementation

1. **Define TypeScript Interfaces**
   - Add interfaces in `/frontend/src/types/`

2. **Create API Service**
   - Add a new service file in `/frontend/src/client/services/`

3. **Create Custom Hook**
   - Add a new hook in `/frontend/src/hooks/`

4. **Create Modal Component**
   - Add a new modal in `/frontend/src/components/Modals/`

5. **Create List Component**
   - Add a new component in `/frontend/src/components/`

6. **Create Page Component**
   - Add a new page in `/frontend/src/pages/`

7. **Add Route**
   - Update the router configuration in `/frontend/src/routes/`

8. **Update Navigation**
   - Add the new page to the navigation menu

## Best Practices

When implementing new features in SpendMila, follow these best practices:

1. **Consistent Naming**
   - Use consistent naming conventions across backend and frontend
   - Follow the existing patterns in the codebase

2. **Type Safety**
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for all frontend components
   - Use Pydantic schemas for backend validation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling in both backend and frontend
   - Use try/catch blocks and provide meaningful error messages

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Test both backend and frontend components

5. **Documentation**
   - Document new API endpoints
   - Add comments to complex logic

6. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the existing project structure
   - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

7. **Performance**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Use React Query for efficient data fetching and caching

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API Validation Errors

If you encounter validation errors in the API response:

1. **Check Schema Definitions**
   - Ensure your Pydantic schemas match the expected data structure
   - Verify that required fields are properly defined

2. **Model Conversion**
   - When returning model instances, convert them to dictionaries using `model_dump()`
   - Handle nested objects properly

3. **Response Model**
   - Make sure the response_model in your API route matches the actual returned data

### Frontend Type Errors

If you encounter TypeScript errors in the frontend:

1. **Check Interface Definitions**
   - Ensure your TypeScript interfaces match the API response structure
   - Update interfaces when the API changes

2. **Component Props**
   - Define proper prop types for all components
   - Use optional props where appropriate

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can maintain the clean architecture of the SpendMila project while adding new functionality. The separation of concerns between backend and frontend components makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend.

I will follow these instructions to deliver high-quality implementations. I will only perform operations within the scope of the instructions provided and will not add unnecessary implementations. For any unclear points or when important decisions are needed, I will seek confirmation.
